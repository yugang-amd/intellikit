# Contributing

To report issues and submit pull requests, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMDResearch/intellikit).

## Set up a development environment

To clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMDResearch/intellikit.git
cd intellikit
```

Each tool within IntelliKit is an independent Python package. You can install the packages you want to work on in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e ./metrix
pip install -e ./linex
pip install -e ./kerncap[dev]
# ...any subset
```

There is no metapackage at the root level of the repository. You must install each package individually.

## Running tests

Each package has its own test suite:

```bash
# Metrix
python3 -m pytest metrix/tests/ -v

# Kerncap unit tests (no GPU required)
PYTHONPATH=kerncap pytest kerncap/tests/unit/ -v

# Kerncap integration tests (requires ROCm + AMD GPU)
PYTHONPATH=kerncap pytest kerncap/tests/integration/ -v
```

## Project structure

The IntelliKit repository is organized as follows.

```
